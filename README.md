A simple game of tic-tac-toe between two players that can be played through the
command line!

Edit: 11/11/2019
- things I would like to improve:
--General code cleanup and refactoring
--reassess if 'board.rb' needs to require 'player.rb'
--put attribute readers, writors, and accessors all in one line
--Examine #game_over method so that the parameters are optional (right now I pass an argument of "" for one of the method calls)
